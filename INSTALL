INSTALL
---------------------------------------------------

The following requirements must be met to compile qg8:
  - An ANSI C compatible C compiler.
  - GNU Make (recommended).
  - GNU GSL (recommended for addons).

Using GNU Make:
  - Go to the project root directory and run `make` to compile the library.
  - Now run `make install` to install the library and headers.
    Note that admin permissions may be required to run this command.
	The library can still be linked locally.
	Note also that a Unix-like system is most likely required.
  - You can tweak the "PREFIX" variable in Makefile to change the install
    location to your liking.
  - If your C compiler does not have a system link to `cc`, edit Makefile and
    change the "CC" variable to the correct command.

Manually:
  - Go to the project root directory and compile all files in src/ to objects.
  - Link all the objects into either a dynamic or static library.
  - Copy the resulting library to your system library install location.
  - Copy all headers in include/ to the folder qg8/ in your systems header
    install location.

UNINSTALL
---------

The headers are installed by default to:
	/usr/local/include/qg8

The library is installed by default to:
	/usr/local/lib/libqg8.so.x.x.x

- If GNU Make is installed, these files can be removed by running
  `make uninstall`.
- Otherwise, you may remove these files manually with no negative consequence.
- Note that admin permissions may be required to remove these files.
